A storage unit rental pricing transparency project 

# 📦 Storage Transparency Project

*A crowdsourced platform for exposing predatory rent practices in the self-storage industry — without doxxing, harassment, or blame on workers.*

---

## 🚨 Problem

Many storage companies — especially those owned by real estate investment trusts (REITs) — lure customers in with promotional rates, only to **raise rents sharply within months**, often without meaningful warning. It's not uncommon for a rate to jump **2–3× in under 6 months**, taking advantage of the fact that most people won't — or can't — easily move out once they've filled a unit.

This behavior is opaque, underregulated, and difficult for consumers to challenge — because there's **no centralized place to compare actual rate hikes**, or understand which companies do this most aggressively.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to:

- **Collect and verify** real-world storage rent increase data from customers
- **Highlight patterns of predatory pricing** across companies and regions
- **Empower renters** to make informed decisions before signing a lease
- Do so in a **privacy-safe, non-harassing way** that protects both users and on-site workers

---

## 🔒 Ethics & Privacy First

- ❌ No doxxing of employees or exact facility addresses  
- ❌ No names or account numbers — users must redact personal info before submission  
- ✅ Built-in redaction tools to obscure sensitive details before upload  
- ✅ Focus on **corporate pricing policy**, *not individual blame*

---

## 🛠️ Core Features (Planned)

- Upload rent increase notices with built-in redaction and guidance
- Manual tagging of:
  - Brand
  - City, state
  - Old and new rent
  - Dates and unit type
- Public, searchable archive of documented rent hikes
- Visual analytics on:
  - Average % increase
  - Time-to-hike
  - Regional and brand-based trends
- Community moderation and trust scoring

## 🚧 Status

This project is in **early development**. We welcome collaborators, testers, and contributors who want to help build a more transparent rental landscape.

## 📄 License

This project will be released under the **MIT License** or **Creative Commons Zero (CC0)**, depending on how data is shared. More details coming soon.
