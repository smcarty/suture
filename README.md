*A storage unit rental pricing transparency project*

## Storage Transparency Project

*A crowdsourced platform for exposing predatory rent practices in the self-storage industry — without doxxing, harassment, or blame on workers.*

---

## Problem

Many storage companies — especially those owned by real estate investment trusts (REITs) — lure customers in with promotional rates, only to **raise rents sharply within months**, often without meaningful warning. It's not uncommon for a rate to jump **2–3× in under 6 months**, taking advantage of the fact that most people won’t — or can’t — easily move out once they've filled a unit.

This behavior is opaque, underregulated, and difficult for consumers to challenge — because there’s **no centralized place to compare actual rate hikes**, or understand which companies do this most aggressively.

---

## Purpose

This project aims to:

- **Collect and verify** real-world storage rent increase data from customers  
- **Highlight patterns of predatory pricing** across companies and regions  
- **Empower renters** to make informed decisions before signing a lease  
- Do so in a **privacy-safe, non-harassing way** that protects both users and on-site workers  

---

## Ethics & Privacy First

- ❌ No doxxing of employees or sharing of exact rental facility addresses or phone numbers  
- ❌ No names or account numbers — users must redact personal info before submission  
- ✅ Built-in redaction tools to obscure sensitive details before upload  
- ✅ Focus is on sharing real-time rental rates and discouraging predatory pricing policies by giving customers real information  

---

## Core Features (Planned)

- Upload rent increase notices with built-in redaction and guidance  
- Manual tagging of:
  - Brand  
  - City, state  
  - Old and new rent  
  - Dates  
  - Unit type (indoor, outdoor, size, etc.)  
- Public, searchable archive of documented rent hikes  
- Visual analytics on:
  - Average % increase  
  - Time-to-hike  
  - Regional and brand-based trends  
- Community moderation and trust scoring

## Status

This project is in **early development**. We welcome collaborators, testers, and contributors who want to help build a more transparent rental landscape.
