## 💌 Why Send a Physical Letter?

Email is easy to ignore. But a mailed letter?

- It gets opened
- It leaves a trace
- And if we’re lucky — it might even give a policymaker a papercut 🩸

> **“Did this site save you a few bucks?”**  
> Then consider helping us make **elevators for everyone** —  
> for the cost of a stamp and the sweet sting of accountability.

Fold. Stamp. Send. It matters.
