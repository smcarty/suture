# Advocacy: Ending ADA Exemptions for Storage Facility Elevators

> Elevators were invented in 1852. There is no good reason for new buildings to be built without them.

---

## The Problem

Current U.S. accessibility law — including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) — **does not require multi-level self-storage facilities to include elevator access**.

This loophole means that new, modern buildings are legally allowed to **deny access to upper floors for anyone with mobility limitations**, including:

- Elderly customers
- People with temporary or permanent injuries
- Parents with small children
- Disabled renters protected under federal law

Many national storage companies exploit this exemption to cut construction costs, especially in rural or working-class areas — even when the rest of the building is newly built and climate-controlled.

---

## Our Position

Storage is **not a luxury** — it is a necessary service used by:

- Families in transition or housing instability  
- People recovering from eviction, divorce, or disaster  
- Workers with seasonal gear  
- Disabled or immunocompromised individuals who cannot keep all items at home
- Small businesses use storage units to store inventory and equipment when affordable retail or warehouse space isn’t affordable.  

Denying access to parts of a facility because someone uses a walker, wheelchair, or simply can't handle stairs is **not acceptable in 2025**.

---

## Our Goal

We want to:

- **Pressure regulators and legislators** to close the ADA loophole
- **Educate the public** on the harm caused by this exception
- **Ensure all future storage buildings** with multiple floors are built with elevator access
- **End the default assumption** that the disabled should "just rent the first floor" while charging a first-floor premium.

## Next Steps

We'll begin organizing:

- An issue brief explaining the loophole and its real-world consequences
- A public letter and petition campaign to push for change
- Outreach to disability rights orgs, housing advocates, and sympathetic lawmakers

## Want to Help?

You don’t have to be a policy expert to get involved. If you’ve:

- Been denied access to an upper unit  
- Had to pay more just to get a ground-floor option  
- Struggled with stairs, carts, or accessibility in a storage facility  

We want to hear from you.

*The ADA is one of America’s proudest civil rights laws — but loopholes like this undermine its promise. Let’s close them.*
